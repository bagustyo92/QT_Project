INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions refer to the package you are installing as
some-package.tar.gz or some-package.zip. The .zip file is intended for use
on Windows.

The directory you choose for the installation will be referred to as
your-install-dir.

Note to Qt Visual Studio Integration users: In the instructions below,
instead of building from command line with nmake, you can use the menu
command 'Qt->Open Solution from .pro file' on the .pro files in the
example and plugin directories, and then build from within Visual
Studio.

Unpacking and installation
--------------------------

1.  Unpacking the archive (if you have not done so already).

    On Unix and Mac OS X (in a terminal window):

	cd your-install-dir
	gunzip some-package.tar.gz
	tar xvf some-package.tar

    This creates the subdirectory some-package containing the files.

    On Windows:

    Unpack the .zip archive by right-clicking it in explorer and
    choosing "Extract All...". If your version of Windows does not
    have zip support, you can use the infozip tools available
    from www.info-zip.org.

    If you are using the infozip tools (in a command prompt window):
	cd your-install-dir
	unzip some-package.zip

2.  Building the component and examples (when required).

    If you would like to build the
    examples, next give the commands

        qmake
        make          [or nmake if your are using Microsoft Visual C++]

    The example program(s) can be found in the directory called
    "examples" or "example".

    Components that are Qt plugins, e.g. styles and image formats, are
    ready to be used as soon as they are built, so the rest of this
    installation instruction can be skipped.


Solutions components are intended to be used directly from the package
directory during development, so there is no 'make install' procedure.


Using a component in your project
---------------------------------

To use this component in your project, add the following line to the
project's .pro file (or do the equivalent in your IDE):

    include(your-install-dir/some-package/src/some-package.pri)

This adds the package's sources and headers to the SOURCES and HEADERS
project variables respectively and
updates INCLUDEPATH to contain the package's src
directory. Additionally, the .pri file may include some dependencies
needed by the package.

To include a header file from the package in your sources, you can now
simply use:

    #include <SomeClass>

or alternatively, in pre-Qt 4 style:

    #include <some-class.h>

!! The End !!
